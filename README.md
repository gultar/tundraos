#NorthernOS
An electron-powered desktop graphical environment

##Installation

You will first need to clone the repo by running the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/gultar/workspace
```

Then you need to install all necessary dependencies:
```
npm install
```

##Running
If you are using the application on Windows,
you may want to enter the Windows Subsystem for Linux, as this project was built
with Linux in mind first.
You can, however, run the following command and have a filesystem built at the root of the
project's directory.
```
npm run electron
```

OR

If you wish to have access to Linux's entire filsystem, run the following command instead:
```
npm run electron-full
```
